    <!-- Design Description Section -->
    <div id="qset-design-section">
      <h3>Design Overview</h3>
      <p>
        The QSET robotic arm was developed to enable precise manipulation for space exploration tasks. 
        The arm consists of six degrees of freedom, offering unparalleled dexterity. The design incorporates 
        advanced parallel-link mechanisms for stability, and the joints are driven using high-efficiency gear trains.

        The base pan provides rotational movement (joint 1), while the shoulder (joint 2) ensures vertical articulation.
        The elbow (joint 3) and forearm rotation (joint 4) enable intermediate positioning, and the wrist (joints 5 and 6) 
        handle fine end-effector manipulations, such as gripping and tool rotations.

    <!-- System Architecture Section -->
    <div id="qset-system-section">
      <h3>System Architecture</h3>
      <p>
        The arm's control architecture is built on an STM32F407 microcontroller, ensuring real-time response. 
        Key components include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Linear actuators for large joint movements</li>
        <li>Servos for fine wrist articulation</li>
        <li>CAN transceiver for robust communication</li>
        <li>Voltage step-down modules for power regulation</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Mathematical Analysis Section -->
    <div id="qset-math-section">
      <h3>Kinematic and Dynamic Analysis</h3>
      <p>
        The arm's motion was modeled using Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters to define the joint transformations.
        The forward kinematics were solved by constructing homogeneous transformation matrices for each joint.

      <p>
        Dynamic analysis involved deriving the equations of motion using Lagrangian mechanics, factoring in torque, 
        inertia, and external forces acting on the arm. The arm's operational stability was ensured by calculating 
        force distributions at each joint under load.
