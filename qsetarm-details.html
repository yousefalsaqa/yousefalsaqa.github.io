      <h3>Design Overview</h3>
      <p>
        The QSET robotic arm was engineered for high-performance operations in space environments. Leveraging 
        a six-degree-of-freedom architecture, it features precision control through gear-driven actuators and a 
        modular design to adapt to a range of payloads and tasks.

      <p>
        The end-effector employs a rotational wrist mechanism capable of fine-grained manipulation, allowing 
        the arm to interact with delicate or dynamic objects. The design integrates parallel-linkage 
        systems to maximize torque while minimizing mechanical stress.

    <!-- System Architecture Section -->
    <div class="showcase-box" id="qset-system-section">
      <h3>System Architecture</h3>
      <p>
        At the heart of the robotic arm's functionality lies a robust system architecture. A real-time STM32F407 
        microcontroller is responsible for precise coordination of actuators and sensors. Communication is 
        handled via a CAN protocol, enabling synchronized data exchange between components.

      <p>
        The architecture integrates key features:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Linear Actuators:</strong> Offer high-torque movement for larger joints.</li>
        <li><strong>Guidance Lasers:</strong> Assist with alignment during object interaction.</li>
        <li><strong>Voltage Regulation:</strong> Step-down modules maintain stable operation under load.</li>
        <li><strong>CAN Transceiver:</strong> Ensures robust communication across the arm and robotic platform.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Kinematics and Dynamics Section -->
    <div class="showcase-box" id="qset-math-section">
      <h3>Kinematics and Dynamics</h3>
      <p>
        The kinematic model of the robotic arm utilizes Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters to define joint 
        transformations. This approach ensures precise calculation of positional and orientational relationships 
        between each segment.

      <p>
        Homogeneous transformation matrices were employed to model the arm's motion within a 3D workspace, while 
        dynamic analysis using Lagrangian equations optimized torque allocation.

      <p>
        The Free Body Diagram (FBD) illustrates the force and moment distribution across the robotic arm. This 
        analysis was instrumental in material selection and structural optimization to withstand the operational 
        loads experienced during tasks.
