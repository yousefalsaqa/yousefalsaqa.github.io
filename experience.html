                <ul>
                  <li>Built the Universal Admission Analysis Dashboard — a Python/Tkinter application that processes 35,000 student records spanning 10 years of admission data</li>
                  <li>Created a dynamic policy threshold calculator that shows real-time impact of changing admission requirements (e.g., "if we raise the Math minimum to 85, how many students from last 5 years would have been rejected?")</li>
                  <li>Developed per-course analysis comparing first-year university GPA against high school subject performance, revealing which HS courses best predict success in specific programs</li>
                  <li>Reverse-engineered the anonymization scheme used in the dataset to enable individual student lookups while maintaining data governance</li>
                  <li>Presented findings to admission leadership, contributing to the decision to raise Commerce thresholds</li>
