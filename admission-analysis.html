          <h2>The Problem</h2>
          <p>Working as a recruitment rep at Queen's, I had access to years of admission data — but it was all trapped in Excel files. Brutal to work with. Every question required manual filtering and pivot tables.</p>
          <p>"How many international students from UAE applied to Engineering last year?" "What schools send us the most Commerce applicants?" Simple questions that took an hour to answer. And bigger questions — like what actually predicts student success — nobody had time to dig into.</p>
        </div>

          <img src="admission_analysis_Dashboard.jpg" alt="Admission Analysis Dashboard interface">
          <figcaption>The main dashboard interface with filtering and visualization</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <div class="case-section">
          <h2>Tool 1: General Admission Explorer</h2>
          <p>The first thing I built was a dashboard to explore the raw admission data — 5 years, roughly 170,000 applications. I pulled the Excel files into SQLite (way faster for queries) and built a Tkinter interface on top.</p>
          
          <h3>What You Could Query</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Demographics:</strong> Country of origin, citizenship, which high school they attended</li>
            <li><strong>Application data:</strong> Programs applied to, admission status (accepted/rejected/waitlisted)</li>
            <li><strong>Responses:</strong> Why they accepted or declined offers, where else they applied</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Instead of spending an hour in Excel, you could answer questions in seconds. The team started using it for reports and presentations almost immediately.</p>
        </div>

        <figure class="case-image">
          <img src="admission_analysis_Dashboard.jpg" alt="Admission Analysis Dashboard interface">
          <figcaption>The general admission dashboard — filter, visualize, export</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <div class="case-section">
          <h2>Tool 2: Commerce Success Predictor</h2>
          <p>This is the one that got interesting. I got access to 10 years of Commerce student data — about 35,000 students — with both their admission info AND their first-year GPA. The question: what actually predicts success in Commerce?</p>
          
          <h3>The Analysis</h3>
          <p>I built a 4-tab dashboard where you could explore correlations:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Overall high school average vs. first-year GPA</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Math grade vs. first-year GPA</strong></li>
            <li><strong>English grade vs. first-year GPA</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Supplementary application score vs. first-year GPA</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Plus a config file system so the same tool could be adapted for different programs without code changes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="case-section">
          <h2>The Findings</h2>
          <p>I used a Random Forest model to identify which factors were the best predictors of first-year success. The results surprised people:</p>
          
          <div class="case-highlight">
            <p><strong>Best predictor:</strong> Overall high school average (no surprise)<br>
            <strong>Second:</strong> Math grade<br>
            <strong>Third:</strong> English grade<br>
            <strong>Fourth:</strong> Supplementary application score — and it had a <em>negative</em> correlation</p>
          </div>

          <p>That last one caught everyone off guard. The supp app — essays, extracurriculars, the "soft" stuff — actually had a slight negative correlation with first-year GPA. Students who wrote great applications weren't necessarily performing better. Maybe they were better at selling themselves than doing the work. Maybe the graders were looking for the wrong things. Either way, it was data worth discussing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="case-section">
          <h2>The Impact</h2>
          <p>I'm not going to claim I walked into a room and said "change your thresholds" and they did it. That's not how universities work. But the analysis was part of the conversation.</p>
          <p>The Commerce program eventually raised their admission thresholds:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Math and English minimums: 80% → 85%</li>
            <li>Overall high school average: 87% → 90%</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Was that directly because of my analysis? I don't know. But the data was there, people saw it, and the change aligned with what the numbers suggested. That felt meaningful.</p>

          <h2>The Struggle: Learning to See Data</h2>
          <p>The hardest part wasn't the coding — it was learning how to analyze. Before this, I thought data analysis was just making charts. It's not. It's asking the right questions, checking your assumptions, understanding what correlations actually mean (and don't mean).</p>
          <p>I spent a lot of time second-guessing myself. "Is this correlation real or did I mess something up?" "Does this p-value actually matter?" "Am I seeing a pattern or just noise?" Learning to look at things from different angles — controlling for variables, checking for confounders — that was the real education.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="case-section">
          <h2>What I Learned</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Data doesn't speak for itself.</strong> You have to ask the right questions. The same dataset can tell different stories depending on how you slice it.</li>
            <li><strong>Correlation isn't causation (but it's still useful).</strong> I can't prove the supp app causes worse performance. But the correlation is worth investigating.</li>
            <li><strong>Build tools that answer questions.</strong> Users don't care about your database schema. They have questions — make the tool answer them fast.</li>
            <li><strong>Excel is brutal at scale.</strong> 170K rows across multiple files? Never again. SQLite saved my sanity.</li>
          </ul>
